# Sciencedirect Live Session Fetcher

Use this skill for the workflow where the browser session is the source of truth.

This skill is appropriate when:

- the target PDFs are on ScienceDirect/Elsevier pages, or on mainstream publisher pages that expose a PDF link
- the user can sign in lawfully through personal or institutional access
- direct requests are blocked by bot verification pages, browser-only flows, or session gates
- the user can keep the authorized Edge or Firefox window open during the run

Do not use this skill to create access the user does not already have.

## Workflow

1. Prepare or confirm the input CSV.
   Required columns: `number`, `doi`.
   Optional columns: `title`, `note`, `year`, `journal`, `formatted`.
   If `note` contains candidate URLs, the fetcher prefers `doi.org` and `sciencedirect.com` links first.

2. Choose a browser route.
   Prefer the Edge DevTools route for ScienceDirect and Elsevier batches. It reuses a real browser session and is the most reliable route for signed ScienceDirect PDF URLs.
   In practice, the Firefox route is the main mixed-publisher path for mainstream non-Elsevier sites, and it now checks metadata fields, script-embedded PDF URLs, dataset-backed buttons, and visible PDF links before giving up.
   Use the Firefox Selenium route for mixed batches across MDPI, Springer Nature, Frontiers, AIP, ASCE, SSRN, ICE / Géotechnique family pages, and similar DOI landing pages when the pages expose a normal PDF link or `citation_pdf_url`.
   Treat the same Firefox route as the intended fallback for other mainstream publisher pages such as Wiley, Taylor & Francis, IEEE, ACM, ACS, Nature Portfolio, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Sage when the page structure exposes a standard PDF target.

3. Launch a dedicated Edge session with remote debugging when using the Edge route.
   Use [scripts/launch_edge_clone_remote_debug.ps1](scripts/launch_edge_clone_remote_debug.ps1).
   This opens a separate Edge window with its own user-data directory and a DevTools port.

4. Let the user complete the manual browser part.
   They must:
   - sign in lawfully when needed
   - pass any bot verification page manually
   - open a representative article
   - click `View PDF` or `Download PDF` once when the site requires it
   - keep the browser window open

5. If needed, probe the live Edge session before a full batch.
   Use [scripts/attach_sciencedirect_remote_debug.py](scripts/attach_sciencedirect_remote_debug.py).
   Read [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) if the probe still shows a bot verification page or missing PDF metadata.

6. Run the serial fetcher.
   Use [scripts/run_devtools_sciencedirect_fetch.ps1](scripts/run_devtools_sciencedirect_fetch.ps1), which wraps [scripts/devtools_sciencedirect_serial_fetch.py](scripts/devtools_sciencedirect_serial_fetch.py).
   Keep `InterItemSleepSeconds` at `5` to `8` unless the user explicitly wants a different pace.
   Python dependencies live in [scripts/requirements.txt](scripts/requirements.txt).
   For ScienceDirect and Elsevier, the current stable path is: article page -> `pdfDownload` metadata -> signed `pdf.sciencedirectassets.com` URL -> fetch inside the live page context. This avoids short-lived signed URL failures that happen when an external HTTP client gets `403 Forbidden`.
   For mixed Firefox batches, use [scripts/firefox_sciencedirect_serial_fetch.py](scripts/firefox_sciencedirect_serial_fetch.py). It first tries ScienceDirect `pdfDownload` metadata, then generic publisher PDF metadata, script-embedded PDF URLs, dataset-backed buttons, and visible PDF links.

7. Review the run output and retry only failed rows.
   The fetcher writes:
   - `pdfs/`
   - `devtools_results.csv`
   - `devtools_missing.csv`
   - `downloaded_doi.txt`
   - `missing_doi.txt`
   - `summary.txt`

## Commands

Launch the Edge session:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '<skill-dir>\scripts\launch_edge_clone_remote_debug.ps1'
```

Launch a direct Edge session with extensions disabled when ScienceDirect or PDF viewer extensions interfere:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '<skill-dir>\scripts\launch_edge_clone_remote_debug.ps1' `
  -DirectConnection `
  -DisableExtensions
```

Launch a one-shot Edge session that applies only to this temporary browser window and ends when the window is closed:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '<skill-dir>\scripts\launch_edge_clone_remote_debug.ps1' `
  -DirectConnection `
  -DisableExtensions `
  -OneShotProfile
```

Launch the recommended clean Elsevier session for a fresh run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '<skill-dir>\scripts\launch_edge_clone_remote_debug.ps1' `
  -DirectConnection `
  -DisableExtensions `
  -OneShotProfile `
  -RemoteDebuggingPort 9222 `
  -Url "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2025.118930"
```

Probe the live session:

```powershell
& '<python>' '<skill-dir>\scripts\attach_sciencedirect_remote_debug.py' --debugger-address 127.0.0.1:9222
```

Run the serial batch:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '<skill-dir>\scripts\run_devtools_sciencedirect_fetch.ps1' `
  -InputCsv C:\path\to\input.csv `
  -OutDir C:\path\to\out-dir `
  -InterItemSleepSeconds 6
```

Run a mixed-publisher Firefox batch:

```powershell
& '<python>' '<skill-dir>\scripts\firefox_sciencedirect_serial_fetch.py' `
  --input-csv C:\path\to\input.csv `
  --out-dir C:\path\to\out-dir `
  --manual-ready-timeout 300 `
  --page-wait-seconds 10 `
  --inter-item-sleep-seconds 6
```

## Guardrails

- Stay inside the user's authorized session. Do not try to bypass access controls.
- The Edge or Firefox window with the live session must remain open during the run.
- Resolve `<skill-dir>` to the installed `sciencedirect-live-session-fetcher`
  skill folder and `<python>` to a real Python 3 executable before running the
  commands. Do not hard-code another user's home directory.
- When sharing this skill, distribute only `SKILL.md`, `agents/`, `references/`,
  and `scripts/`. Do not include `runtime/`, browser profiles, `__pycache__`,
  downloaded PDFs, session output folders, cookies, or authentication artifacts.
- `-OneShotProfile` creates a temporary dedicated Edge user-data directory for this launched session only. It does not modify Windows proxy settings or global browser proxy settings, and closing that Edge window ends the effect.
- If the session is still on a bot verification page, stop and let the user finish it manually.
- If Edge opens `extension://.../pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=...`, the PDF is being handled by a browser extension. Prefer restarting the DevTools Edge session with `-DisableExtensions`; the `file=` value is a short-lived ScienceDirect signed URL and may expire within minutes.
- A probe result can be mixed. If `has_view_pdf=true` and `has_pdf_metadata=true`, a single-row probe download is often worth trying even when the page still reports a challenge flag. Do not jump straight to the full batch until that probe succeeds.
- For non-ScienceDirect publishers, only use PDF URLs exposed in page metadata or visible links such as `citation_pdf_url`, `.pdf`, `/pdf`, `/epdf`, `Download PDF`, `View PDF`, or authorized delivery endpoints.
- Prefer retrying a small failed subset instead of rerunning the full list immediately.

## Lessons Learned

- For ScienceDirect and Elsevier, a clean one-shot Edge session with `-DirectConnection -DisableExtensions -OneShotProfile` is the best default starting point.
- Firefox can work well for mixed non-Elsevier publishers, but ScienceDirect is more sensitive to automated Firefox sessions and can fall back to `please wait` or signed-URL failures.
- The ScienceDirect `pdf.sciencedirectassets.com` links are short-lived signed URLs. If you extract them, use them immediately inside the authorized browser session or in the page context; do not treat them as durable links.
- Browser PDF extensions can silently replace the real PDF tab with `extension://...viewer.html?file=...`. When that happens, disable extensions and restart the session instead of retrying the same run repeatedly.

- Read [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) when you need the exact run order or parameter choices.
- Read [references/workflow.zh-CN.md](references/workflow.zh-CN.md) when the user prefers Chinese operational guidance.
- Read [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) when the live session attaches but cannot expose PDF metadata or the viewer bytes.
